# Apirelio quickstart

This is the smallest integration path for the package. It uses the synthetic customer `customer_42`; replace that resolver with your authenticated account lookup before production.

```bash
export APIRELIO_API_KEY=apr_live_your_project_key
composer require slim/slim slim/psr7 apirelio/slim && php -S localhost:3000 -t public
```

Generate one request to the example endpoint, wait for the asynchronous batch to flush, then open the [live demo](https://apirelio.com/demo?utm_source=github&utm_medium=example&utm_campaign=slim) to understand the resulting customer-aware views.

The SDK never captures request or response payloads. Do not put secrets or personal data into customer identity or custom metadata.
